Useful Methods to build readable Python code faster.<br>
I recently worked on a large JavaScript project and only near the end did I start
making lots of little helpful methods to reduce (the probability of low level) bugs and add readability to the project
and the methods sped up my programming speed dramatically.

I am also a fan of verb based function names rather than RPN style of how built in functions
(if they exist) are worded and I wanted to be able to reduce whole maticulous procedures into simple methods to save
time and circumvent bugs (and to reduce how much code I write) which eats up precious time and throw me off track
when I'm in the flow of writing code at a higher intent level rather than being incased in the boolean logic level
at the level that the machine takes instructions. 

So for the reasons above I have started making my Python Method Library that will eventually
number in the thousands and I will build a gui and search engine with categories and use
frequency of use analysis to combine many together to gain even more speed.
