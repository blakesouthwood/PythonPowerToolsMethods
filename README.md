Useful Methods to build readable Python code faster.<br>
I recently worked on a large JavaScript project and only near the end did I start
making lots of little helpful methods to reduce (the probability of low level) bugs and add readability to the project
and the methods sped up my programming speed dramatically.

I am also a fan of verb based function names rather than RPN style of how built in functions
(if they exist) are worded and I wanted to be able to reduce whole maticulous procedures into simple methods to save
time and circumvent bugs (and to reduce how much code I write) which eats up precious time and throws me off track
when I'm in the flow of writing code (and thinking) at a higher intent level rather than being incased in the microscopic boolean logic level at the level that the machine reads instructions in the ALU in binary. 

I discovered that it's much more practical and efficent to write above the source code level with methods to
work closer to the human meaning level of thinking and intent and what something does rather than maticulously
being chained to the tiny how to do something steps that the programming language affords. It's much easier
to describe do something with methods then write a page of code of tiny how to steps which requires 50% of the time
testing(debugging trivial bugs) all that "new" green code when it's faster and easier to reuse what already exists and has been tested. There is incredible redunancy of repeatedly writing fresh code(yet untested)  (rarely reused previously) to do tiny subtasks when it makes perfect sense to make a small method step (section of a function) to reduce the spelling errors, reduce thinking time, and increase the library of machine behaviors to get code working faster (and reduce bugs) and yet the code is actually more readable. 


So for the reasons above I have started making my Python Method Library that will eventually
number in the thousands and I will build a gui and search engine with categories and use
frequency of use analysis to combine many together to gain even more speed.

The important aspect is that Fred Brooks said that the only ways known to definitely write software faster are
to use high level langauges and reuse code and interative programming. I'm trying to implement his teachings from
the Mythical Man Month coupled (eventually) with Literate programming invented by Don Knuth at Stanford. Tony Hoare
also wrote a famous paper on High Level Language Design and harped on readability for humans and to use levels.
Tony Hoare mentioned the importance of a good Standard Library. Though coming down the pipe JavaScript has one coming
and currently Python has many Standard Libraries I'm trying to make Python more friendly for the millions that will
soon be emersed in Python coding. In David Flanigan's book "The Definitive Guide of JavaScript" he stressed the 
importance of a good Standard Library.
